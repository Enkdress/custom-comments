The purpose of this project is to have a chat component to **implement in NextJs**
projects if needed.

This project **does not** use **websockets** that usually is used on this type of
components, instead this component use [**SWR**](https://swr.vercel.app/) (react hook) to manage the state of the chat.

For styling [**ant design**](https://ant.design/) was the election, it allows shortest time of development.
